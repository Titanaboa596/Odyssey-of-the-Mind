We believe in the power of creativity and problem-solving to address the pressing environmental issues of our time1.

     In our skit, we've incorporated themes that highlight the importance of preserving our natural world. We've drawn inspiration from various scientific fields such as earth science, space, chemistry, and physics. One of our skits, for instance, revolves around the theme of pollution and presents an original solution to reduce it.
     
     We want to take these themes a step further. Our goal is not just to raise awareness but to inspire action. We believe that every individual has a role to play in saving our environment.">
